Hello! Welcome to my personal website. I am Tristan Butzine, I have a software development Associate's degree from Northeast Wisconsin Technical College and a passion for learning. This person website of mine will show off some of my skills. Currently, I have an internship where I work as a backend developer, most of my time in school was focused on backend development. I enjoy backend, but I also really enjoy frontend. So I have decided to get better at frontend skills on my own! My goal is to be a full-stack developer, and not be limited but what my school had to offer. The languages/frameworks that I am planning on covering are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Vue.js, maybe a bit of Rust and Type script. Heck there may even been an ASP.NET site on here eventually. For databases I want to try a couple things out, including a firebase realtime database, a classic sql database and maybe loading small information from a plain old json file.
